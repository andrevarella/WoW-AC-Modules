# mod-bg-set-level

This is a very simple module to change all player to a certain level when they enter a battleground, and to restore original level afterwards. The level used can be set in the config.

There might be some issues of player gear and spells, such as some gear from high level quest not having a level requirement, so this module is more for fun use than for create a competitive environment!
